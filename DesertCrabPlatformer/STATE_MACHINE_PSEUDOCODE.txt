Player presses LMB while Jumping or Falling

IF Player is in range of a hook

Set player state to Swinging
// This disables gravity on player entirely
// Fully custom movement programmatically

Player pawn is lerped to nearest point in the "hook arc"

Left/Right arrow keys generate momentum along the ark

IF player releases LMB they are set to Falling state
// Player is given a linear force equivalent to the 
// force they had along the "hook arc" upon release
